// You are given two strings. In a single move, you can choose any of them, and delete the first (i.e. leftmost) character.

// For Example:

// By applying a move to the string "where", the result is the string "here".
// By applying a move to the string "a", the result is an empty string "".
// Implement a function that calculates the minimum number of moves that should be performed to make the given strings equal.
