// A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x − 2y is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last 
// digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained; 
// you can stop when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or 
// not.

// The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.

// Examples:

// 1 - m = 371 -> 37 − (2×1) -> 37 − 2 = 35 ; thus, since 35 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7.
